MISSION: Detect anomalous volume variations based on day-of-week patterns.

KEY PRINCIPLE: Compare like-to-like (Monday to Monday, Tuesday to Tuesday, etc.)

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Read data source CV to understand normal volume ranges and patterns

2. Get today's volumes:
```sql
   SELECT filename, rows, uploaded_at 
   FROM data 
   WHERE from = 'today' AND rows > 0
   ORDER BY rows DESC;
```

3. Compare with same weekday last week:
```sql
   SELECT 
       t.filename,
       t.rows as today_volume,
       l.rows as lastweek_volume,
       ROUND(((t.rows - l.rows) * 100.0 / NULLIF(l.rows, 0)), 2) as pct_change,
       ABS(t.rows - l.rows) as abs_difference
   FROM 
       (SELECT * FROM data WHERE from = 'today') t
   INNER JOIN 
       (SELECT * FROM data WHERE from = 'last_weekday') l
   ON t.filename = l.filename
   WHERE l.rows > 0;
```

4. Identify significant variations:
```sql
   SELECT 
       t.filename,
       t.rows as today_volume,
       l.rows as lastweek_volume,
       ROUND(((t.rows - l.rows) * 100.0 / NULLIF(l.rows, 0)), 2) as pct_change
   FROM 
       (SELECT * FROM data WHERE from = 'today') t
   INNER JOIN 
       (SELECT * FROM data WHERE from = 'last_weekday') l
   ON t.filename = l.filename
   WHERE l.rows > 0
   AND ABS(((t.rows - l.rows) * 100.0 / NULLIF(l.rows, 0))) > 50;
```

ANOMALY DETECTION RULES:
- Volume change >50% compared to same weekday last week
- Sudden spikes or drops that deviate from documented patterns
- Volume significantly different from expected ranges in CV

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Weekend patterns may differ from weekdays (verify in CV)
- End-of-month files may have different volumes
- Seasonal patterns (check CV for seasonal expectations)
- Check if variation is consistent with business events

THRESHOLDS:
- 🚨 CRITICAL: >100% increase or >80% decrease
- ⚠️ WARNING: 50-100% increase or 50-80% decrease
- ✅ NORMAL: <50% variation

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Only files with SIGNIFICANT unexpected variations (>50% change)
- Include both today's and last week's volumes
- Calculate and report percentage change
- Classify severity based on thresholds above
- Consider documented volume ranges from CV
